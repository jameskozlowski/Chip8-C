* Chip-8 
* 
* Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems 
* in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. 
* These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input. 
* The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller.
*
* In the early 1990s, the Chip-8 language was revived by a man named Andreas Gustafsson. He created a Chip-8 interpreter for the HP48 graphing calculator, 
* called Chip-48. The HP48 was lacking a way to easily make fast games at the time, and Chip-8 was the answer. Chip-48 later begat Super Chip-48, 
* a modification of Chip-48 which allowed higher resolution graphics, as well as other graphical enhancements.
*
* Chip-48 inspired a whole new crop of Chip-8 interpreters for various platforms, including MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Amiga, HP48, MSX, Adam, and ColecoVision.
